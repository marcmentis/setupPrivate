#RAILS-poc

`RAILS-poc` is designed to help developers write Ruby on Rails (_Rails_) applications within the _nys-its_. The RAILS-poc `code` can be used (i) to fast-track Rails application development, or (ii) as a template that you can use in your own applications. The RAILS-poc `Wiki` gives more detail on how the `master` versions/tags were created, as well as how to set-up, migrate, and contribute to rails applications within the _nys-its_.

###How to Use RAILS-poc
#####Fast-track your _Rails_ application development
* Clone `RAILS-poc` to your machine's 'projects' folder. 
* `Basic Configuration`
  * If you want to use all of the basic configuration, do nothing more, leave `head` at v0.04. Basic configuration includes the following installed and configured: home page, testing gems, debugging gems, mobile first responsive design gem (zurb foundation).
  * If you want some, but not all, of the 'basic configuration' you can `checkout` the appropriate `tag` on the `master` branch. You will get cumulatively more 'basic configuration' as you `checkout` `tags` from v0.01 through v0.04.
    * [v0.01](https://github.com/nys-its/rails-poc/wiki/v0.01-StaticPages-Home-Page) Static Pages tag - Home Page, README.md (.rdoc converted to .md)
    * [v0.02](https://github.com/nys-its/rails-poc/wiki/v0.02-Testing) Testing tag - RSpec, Capybara, FactoryGirl (Spring as app preloader)
    * [v0.03](https://github.com/nys-its/rails-poc/wiki/v0.03-Debugging) Debugging tag - ByeBug, BetterErrors, RailsPanel
    * v0.04 Mobile First Responsive Design tag - Zurb Foundation
* `Specific Functionality` 
  * Will be added over time as useful functional needs are identified
  * Will be found on `branches`. Every `branch` will be a child of `v0.04`.
  * To get the `specific function` on your machine, `checkout` the appropriate `branch` and  `merge` into `master`.

#####Use code as a template that you can use in your own applications
* Clone `RAILS-poc` to your machine's 'code' folder.
* View code in editor
